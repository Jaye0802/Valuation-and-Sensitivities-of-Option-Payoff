# Valuation and Sensitivities of Option Payoffs

This repository is to exploring the valuation and sensitivities of the European vanilla/exotic call option payoffs. It focuses on applying quantitative methods to model, price, and analyze various option strategies, with an emphasis on practical implementation and deeper insights into derivative instruments.

## Topics and Techniques

This repository covers a variety of topics and techniques, including:

### 1. **Option Valuation Models**
- **Black-Scholes Model**: Analytical pricing for European-style options.
- **Binomial Tree Models**: Stepwise evaluation for American and European options.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulation-based pricing for complex payoffs.

### 2. **Sensitivity Analysis (Greeks)**
- **Delta**: Rate of change of option price with respect to the underlying asset price.  
- **Gamma**: Sensitivity of delta to changes in the underlying asset price.  
- **Theta**: Time decay of the option's value as expiration approaches.  
- **Vega**: Sensitivity
